# Payroll UI Documentation

## Introduction

The UI package is designed with the aim of centralizing the common components utilized in
the [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) project, along with encapsulating components derived from this library. This
package fosters a clean and coherent architecture, facilitating component reusability and code maintainability within
the project ecosystem.

## Guidelines

### Directory Structure

- All components should reside in the `src/components/ui` directory.
- Each new component should be housed in a new folder, following the structure `components/ui/button` for a `Button`
  component, for instance.
- Principal components: these are components that provide direct functionality usage. For example, a `Table` component
  is divided into `TableHeader`, `TableBody`, and `TableFooter`, but it's only necessary to create a `Story` for the
  main `Table` component, not for its sub-components.

### Naming Convention

- File naming should follow the `some-component` format.
- Utilities should be housed within `lib/utilities`.
- Each file should export its interface; there's no need for a separate file for interface definition.

### Documentation and Visualization

- To enhance the documentation and visualization of components, a Storybook project has been set up allowing for a more
  interactive visualization of components and demonstrating their correct usage.
- Each principal component should have an associated story within `src/stories/components`. It's not necessary to create
  stories for sub-components, only for the principal component.
- Every principal component and its sub-components should be exported in `src/index.ts`, so that they can be utilized by
  other packages.

## Development Workflow

### Development Environment

- To initiate component development and test them in real time, run `yarn storybook` to start the development server
  that will listen for changes within `src/stories`.
- Execute `yarn watch` for continuous compilation of new package files, generating necessary Tailwind CSS styles, and
  dynamically reflecting changes to UI components.
