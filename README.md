Some of the above are dependencies that will install locally in your project, but installing them globally
will help you leverage their CLI tools without having to prefix them with `yarn` or `npm run`.

We also strongly recommend using [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) as your IDE.

## Getting Started
1. Install all dependencies:
    ```shell
    yarn install
    ```

2. Ensure all your `apps` have a `.env` file in their root directory. You can copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:
    ```shell
    cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
    cp apps/frontend/.env.example apps/frontend/.env
   
    # Expand this as needed for other apps.
   
    # This goes without saying, but make sure you edit the 
    # `.env` files to match your local environment.
    ```

3. Run the API and frontend development servers:
    ```shell
    nx serve frontend
    nx serve api
    ```
